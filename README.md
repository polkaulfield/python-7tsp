# python-7tsp
Open Source 7tsp clone written in python

This is my attempt to have an alternative to the closed-source 7tsp windows application to change icons on Windows.
It uses Python and a couple of binary utilities. 7za.exe from 7zip and ResourceHacker.exe from (http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/).

This utility is currently usable, but it still doesn't have a GUI. You have to place the 7tsp icon packs in the iconpacks folder.
After patching, ALWAYS make a copy of the unpatched folder, so you have a backup in the case anything goes wrong.
Here you have a lot of icon packs made by niivu (https://github.com/niivu/7tsp-Icon-themes). Tested a lot of them and I didn't have problems.

As always, any pull request is welcome to improve this :)
